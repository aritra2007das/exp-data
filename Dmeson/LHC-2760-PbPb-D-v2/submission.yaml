  CERN-LHC.  Measurements of the elliptic flow V2 (the second Fourier coefficient)  in azimuthally anisotropic distributions of D0, D+ and D*+ mesons, and their anitparticles,  produced in Lead-Lead  interactions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV/nucleon-nucleon collision.  The data cover the central rapidity region (|y|<0.8) and the centrality class 30-50%.  Data  are presented as a function of the D meson transverse momentum.

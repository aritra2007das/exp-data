comment: |
  CERN LHC.  Measurements of the production of prompt charmed mesons D0, D+ and D*+, and their   antiparticles, produced in Lead-Lead collisions at a centre-of-mass energy/nucleon of 2.76 TeV   using data collected during the first LHC heavy-ion run during November and December 2010. Transverse  momenta yields are measured in the PT range 2-16 GeV/c and |y|<0.5 and are used to calculated the   nuclear modification factor RAA with respect to a proton-proton  reference obtained from the cross  section measured at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and scaled to 2.76 GeV.
